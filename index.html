    <hr>
    <p>Grigahcine was born to a French father and an Algerian mother in Paris, France and grew up in Ermont, a banlieue
        district outside Paris, In his youth,
        Grigahcine produced graffiti art, earning him the moniker "Snake" because he was able to consistently evade the
        police. Of his name, Grigahcine says "When I started DJing, everyone called me 'Snake' in my city first, I was
        like 'DJ Snake, OK let's go for it.' The name sucks, but it's too late now." He started DJing at age 14, and
        later producing at 19 years old.In his early career, Grigahcine performed at clubs including Les Bains
        Douches in Paris. In 2005, he met his manager Steve Goncalves, who encouraged Grigahcine to begin creating his
        own music.</p>
